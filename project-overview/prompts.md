I’m going to give you access to several files that contain the following information for the application you’ll create: problem statement, requirements, proposed solution and Jira tickets assigned to the developer for the initial sprint. Do not do anything with this information yet, other than store it in your memory for future reference. Don't generate any code at all until I specifically ask you to do so.
