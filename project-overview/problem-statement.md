# Problem Statement: AI-Powered Design Tool Suite

Design professionals often face time-consuming, repetitive tasks that, while necessary, detract from their core creative work. There's a need for an integrated suite of AI-powered tools that can automate and enhance these "non-creative, creative" tasks. This suite should include:

1. A user persona generator that can analyze websites to create detailed user profiles.
2. A brand auditing tool that processes various data sources to provide insights on brand perception.
3. A competitive analysis tool that researches and compares a company with its top competitors.
4. A brand building assistant that helps develop and maintain consistent brand guidelines.

The suite should be modular for easy expansion, integrate multiple AI agents for complex tasks, and store data in a way that allows for deep analysis and insight generation. It should also be able to create AI chatbots based on generated user personas for simulated interactions.

The challenge is to develop this suite as a full-stack web application, utilizing Python for backend processes, Neo4j for complex data relationships, Supabase for business logic, and Qwik JS for a responsive front-end. The system must be scalable, user-friendly, and capable of handling various data inputs while maintaining data security and user privacy.
